Default Configuration : 

	Number of Cities : 48
	Number of MPI Nodes : 10
	Number of Iterations : 2500

To Run the Project On a GPU Node , follow the following steps :

	1) Untar the folder hppc_report.tar.gz on the Jinx cluster.

	Method 1:
	
	2) Run the script compile_script.sh to compile the project . Note : If the script does not compile, try to set the environment variables
           to point to the correct path to the libraries. You could do ::  export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH

	3) Submit the pbs file : qsub TSP.pbs 

 	4) Note that if default parameters are changed (such as number of processes) , the globalData.h file needs to be updated with these val-           ues as well.


	Method 2:
	
	2) Obtain a GPU node using the command (qsub -I -q class -l nodes=1:gpu -d $(pwd))

	3) Run the script compile_script.sh to compile the project . Note : If the script does not compile, try to set the environment variables           to point to the correct path to the libraries. You could do ::  export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH

	4) After successfully compiling the script , run the executable via the following command : 
		mpirun --hostfile nodename -np 10 ./TSP   (nodename is a file containing the current GPU jinx node number)

	5) Note that if default parameters are changed (such as number of processes) , the globalData.h file needs to be updated with these val-	   ues as well.

To change default parameters :

	1) Untar the folder sample_data.tar.gz.
	
	2) Copy OPTTSP<numberofcities> file to OPTTSPTour.txt in the hppc_project folder. Copy TSPData<numberofcities> to TSPData.txt in the hp-           pc_project folder. 

	3) Change the numMPINodes to <numberofNodes you want to run on> and NUM_CITIES to <numberofcities you want to run . (available cities d-	   ata {48 , 150 , 280 , 666} )

	4) In the TSP.pbs change ( similarly for Method 2) :
		mpirun --hostfile nodename -np <numberofMPINodes you entered in globalData.h file> ./TSP

Output Generated (as shown in the report) :

	1) Latency ( each iteration )

	2) Bandwidth ( each iteration )

	3) Distance of intermediate paths generated

	4) Final Path and distance of the Path after N iterations

	5) Actual Path and its distance
